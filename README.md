# Labeling Datasets on OrbisDB with Label Studio

This repository is a forked + altered version of the open-source [Label Studio Framework](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio) that has been edited to show how OrbisDB (on the Ceramic Network) can be used as a storage destination for human-labeled data. We've preserved the original [README](README-original.md) separately.

In this example, we show how datasets labeled for sentiment analysis can be piped from the Label Studio framework to OrbisDB.
